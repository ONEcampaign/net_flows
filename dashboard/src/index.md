# Net flows to developing countries

For this research, we use data from the [World Bank's International Debt Statistics (IDS)](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/international-debt-statistics) database and the OECD DAC [Creditor Reporting System (CRS)](https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=crs1) database.

## A note on the data

In terms of **inflows** we focus on:
- Debt disbursements of public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) long-term debt. This includes debt from bilateral, multilateral and private creditors.
- Grant disbursements (from providers of Official Development Assistance who report to the OECD DAC). 


In terms of **outflows** we focus on:
- Debt service payments (including both principal and interest payments)

In this context, **net flows** mean PPG debt and grant inflows minus debt service payments on PPG debt.

All debt is Public and Publicly Guaranteed long-term debt. In other words, "private" debt (for example) is debt public debt owed to private creditors.

<div class="note">
We only include countries with available data on inflows and outflows. We exclude Russia, China, and Ukraine from the list of debtors/recipients, given the significant resources flowing to and from these countries, related to conflict and geopolitics.
